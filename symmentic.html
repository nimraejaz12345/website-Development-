                       <h2>Facts about dogs</h2>
                      <p> Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time. Unlike humans, dogs don’t have the ability to
                    create actual measures of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t know how to read clocks. So, telling
                    them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we understand that you feel like you have to do it anyway!
                    Dogs are capable of being trained based on past events, and can be taught to anticipate future events based on past
                    experiences. Pavlov’s dogs are the perfect example of this.</p>

    The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct
    Pleistocene
    wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by
    hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.
